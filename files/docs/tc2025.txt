Abstract

Emerging persistent memory (PM) technologies offer data persistence at close-to-DRAM latency, causing the legacy multi-layer storage stack to become a bottleneck. On the other hand, PM improves I/O efficiency while also introducing unique hardware features that require software modifications to exploit them. In this paper, we propose HYTE, a native table storage engine for hybrid memory, which abstracts the data service for the database’s table. HYTE performs a cross-layer design across the file system and storage engine to avoid the pitfalls of layered abstraction and provides SQL-compatible APIs. Meanwhile, it co-designs with PM’s properties to unlock the hardware’s performance potential. Furthermore, HYTE is hotness-aware and equipped with a suite of lightweight, customized fetching and eviction strategies. Our evaluation shows that HYTE can perform up to 1.4-7.2×better than existing state-of-the-art PM-based storage systems in industry and academia.

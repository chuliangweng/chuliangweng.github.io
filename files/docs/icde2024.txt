Abstract

With the rapid development of storage and network technology, emerging high-performance hardware is being widely applied to the distributed storage cluster. However, existing distributed storage systems employing multi-layer abstractions to provide table data services result in leaving high-speed hardware under-exploited. In this paper, we propose TEngine, a native distributed table storage engine designed for NVMe SSD and RDMA. The key is that TEngine removes the file abstraction to directly construct table structures on the device. For metadata service, TEngine designs a decoupled single metadata server, reducing distributed coordination, easing the burden on the metadata node, and enabling localized data node access. For data service, TEngine optimizes the parallel processing capability of NVMe devices by integrating upper-level multi-thread parallel operations with lower-level NVMe devicesâ€™ parallel I/O processing. Moreover, TEngine introduces a periodic pull-based data synchronization approach to transform data pushing into periodic data pulling, which offloads the synchronization burden from the leader to the followers. The experimental results show that TEngine outperforms state-of-the-art distributed storage systems using the same hardware environment.
